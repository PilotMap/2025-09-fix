    <h1 class="display-4">Introduction to Version 4</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Version 4 of LiveSectional adds many new features for builders to take advantage of. Take a look;
        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to display <a href="https://www.aviationweather.gov/static/help/taf-decode.php" target="_blank">TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts)</a>.
          <li>Added the ability to display <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mdl/mos_home" target="_blank">MOS (Model Output Statistics)</a>. Only available for the United States and Territories.
          <li>Heat Map was added to display what airports have been landed at, and how often. Home airport can be designated.
	  <li>Added the ability to install a rotary switch so viewer can select what data to display, METAR's, TAF's, MOS or Heat Map.
          <li>If rotary switch is not installed, the software can set a default data to display. i.e. METAR's.
          <li>Sleep Timer - The Map can be put to sleep at night (or anytime) if desired. Pressing a pushbutton will turn on temporarily.
          <li>Reload the config settings automatically. The map will restart and reload the settings when new settings are saved.
          <li>Map builder has the ability to use both types of LED's, either RGB and/or GRB color encoding.
          <li>Decoded the airport ID to show City and State. Also will display IP address if an LCD/OLED display is used.
	  <li>Logging capabilities were added to help with diagnosing issues.
          <li>The builder can now download and backup the config file, airports file and logfile if desired.
          <li>This user interface was improved to optimize for mobile applications.
        </ul>
    </p>
  <hr>
    <p class="lead">

	<ul>
	  <li>Settings Editor - Use this editor to set up all the settings for the builder's map.
	  <li>Airports Editor - Use to create the airports file specific to the builder's map.
	  <li>Heat Map Editor - Use this to set which airports have been landed at, and how often.
	</ul>
    </p>
  <hr>
    <p class="lead">
        There are 2 other menus;

	  <li>LED Map with Display 
             <ul>
              <li>LED Map with LCD display - Use a 16x2 LCD to display Wind Speed and Direction information.
	      <li>LED Map with single OLED display - Use a single SSD1306 OLED display to show the same information.
              <li>LED Map with multiple OLED displays - Use up to 8 SSD1306 OLED displays to create a great display of data.
              <li>LED Map with display and Rotary Switch - The addition of the rotary switch gives the viewer the
                  ability to choose what to display, METAR data, TAF data, MOS data or Heat Map. Displays will show what data 
		  is being displayed, along with local and zulu time if desired.
	     </ul>
	  <li>Map with Legend - Legend can be added on any of the above maps if desired.
	     <ul>
