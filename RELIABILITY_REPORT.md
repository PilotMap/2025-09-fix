2. **logging_config.py** - Production-grade logging with rotation and rate limiting
3. **animation_controller.py** - Centralized LED animation with frame rate limiting

### Phase 2: Service Hardening
1. **metar-v4.py** - Fix infinite loops, add health monitoring, improve exception handling
2. **leds.py** - Thread safety, resource cleanup, hardware conflict detection
3. **app.py** - Fix memory leaks, add synchronization, improve error handling

### Phase 3: System Configuration

3. **Stress testing suite** - Validate reliability improvements

## Specific Fixes for Blinking Effects

### Wind Alert Blinking
- **Problem:** Uncoordinated timing causing resource conflicts
- **Solution:** Shared frame clock with deterministic duty cycles
- **Implementation:** `animation_controller.BlinkEffect` class

### Weather Effects (Rain/Snow/Lightning)
- **Problem:** Multiple effects running simultaneously without coordination
- **Solution:** Priority-based effect system with resource sharing
- **Implementation:** Effect queue with bounded resource usage

### Homeport Fading
- **Problem:** 256-iteration loop without bounds checking
- **Solution:** Bounded iterations with timeout detection
- **Implementation:** `animation_controller.FadeEffect` with safety limits

## SD Card Protection Strategy

### Log Management
- **Persistent logs:** `/var/log/livesectional/` with 5MB rotation, 10 backups
- **Debug logs:** `/run/livesectional/` (tmpfs) for high-volume data
- **Rate limiting:** Prevent log flooding during animation loops
- **Compression:** Automatic compression of rotated logs

### Filesystem Optimization
- **Mount options:** `noatime` to reduce write operations
- **Tmpfs usage:** Ephemeral data in RAM instead of SD card
- **Periodic sync:** Controlled fsync patterns, not in hot paths

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Application-Level Health Monitoring
- **Main loop heartbeat:** Detect hung processes
- **LED responsiveness:** Verify hardware functionality
- **Memory usage tracking:** Detect leaks early
- **Performance metrics:** Frame timing, CPU usage, I/O patterns

### System-Level Monitoring
- **Systemd watchdogs:** 30-second timeout for hang detection
- **Resource limits:** Memory, CPU, file handles
- **Automatic restart:** On failure with exponential backoff
- **Health check endpoints:** Web interface status monitoring

## Testing and Validation

### Stress Testing
- **Blinking effect stress:** Rapid toggling for extended periods
- **Resource exhaustion:** Memory, file handles, network failures
- **Timing conflicts:** Concurrent operations, rapid config changes
- **Hardware stress:** DMA conflicts, GPIO contention

### Soak Testing
- **Duration:** 48-72 hours continuous operation
- **Monitoring:** CPU < 50%, stable memory usage, log size limits
- **Failure scenarios:** Network outages, filesystem issues, hardware conflicts
- **Recovery validation:** Graceful restart, state preservation
